# RoverControlApp
Work in progress app for easier control over our rover: https://raptors.p.lodz.pl/

It's currently more of a prototype to test different solutions and pick the most performant one.

Written in dotnet6 using Godot Engine for UI due to vast platform support (Windows, Linux, iOS), new dotnet support and high performance.

Right now features an ONVIF PTZ control over a camera movement and RTSP h264 stream display.
